One of the simplest yet most powerful inbound digital marketing assets is a blog, which allows your website to capitalize on the terms which your ideal customers are searching for. Outbound marketing: In outbound marketing marketers aim to put a marketing message directly in front of as many people as possible in the online space &#8212; regardless of whether it’s relevant or welcomed.

<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">All digital marketers have their own marketing strategies for acquiring and retaining more customers in this challenging and competitive market. There’s a huge spectrum of tactics and assets for successful digital marketing. And the best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each asset or tactic supports their overarching goals. Some of the most common assets and tactics are :</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 class="_2cuy _50a1 _2vxa"><span class="_4yxr">Tactics </span>:</h3>
<ul class="_5a_q _5yj1" dir="ltr">
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) :</strong> The process of optimizing your website to ‘rank’ higher in search engine results pages, therefore increasing the amount of organic (or free) traffic that your website receives.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Native Advertising :</strong> Native advertising refers to advertisements that are primarily content-led and featured on a platform alongside other, non-paid content. BuzzFeed sponsored posts are a good example, but many people also consider social media advertising to be ‘native’ &#8212; for example, Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Pay-Per-Click ( PPC ) :</strong> A method of driving traffic to your website by paying a publisher every time your ad is clicked. One of the most common types of PPC is Google AdWords.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Affiliate Marketing :</strong> A type of performance-based advertising where you receive commission for promoting someone else’s products or services on your website.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Content Management Software (CMS) :</strong> A software application used to create and manage digital content for the purpose of generating brand awareness, traffic growth, lead generation, or customers. It has two components CMA and CDA where CMA is a graphical user interface that allows the user to control the creation, modification and removal of content from a website without needing to know anything about HTML.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Social Media Marketing :</strong> The practice of promoting your brand and your content on social media channels using social media platforms and websites to increase brand awareness, drive traffic, and generate leads for your business.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Email Marketing :</strong> Companies use email marketing as a way of communicating with their audiences. Email is often used to promote content, discounts and events, as well as to direct people towards the business’ website.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Mobile Marketing :</strong> Mobile marketing is multi-channel online marketing technique focused at reaching a specific audience on their smart phone, tablets, or any other related devices through websites, E mail, SMS and MMS, social media or mobile applications. To make the users engaged with a company online via mobile devices need to implement a mobile-friendly or responsive website design to make browsing user-friendly for those on mobile devices.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Marketing Automation :</strong> Marketing automation refers to the software that exists with the goal of automating marketing actions. Many marketing departments have to automate repetitive tasks such as emails, social media, and other website actions.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa"><strong>Online Public Relation (PR) :</strong> Online PR is the practice of securing earned online coverage with digital publications, blogs, and other content-based websites. It’s much like traditional PR, but in the online space. Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation’s target audience, the media, relevant trade media, and other opinion leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="_2cuy _50a1 _2vxa">Benefits of Digital Marketing : Unlike most offline marketing efforts, digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time. With digital marketing, one can measure the ROI (Return on Investment) of pretty much any aspect of one’s marketing efforts. Here are some examples:</h3>
<h3 class="_2cuy _50a1 _2vxa"><span class="_4yxr">Website Traffic </span>:</h3>
<ul class="_5a_q _5yj1" dir="ltr">
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">With digital marketing, you can see the exact number of people who have viewed your website’s homepage in real time by using digital analytics software like HubSpot. You can also see how many pages they visited, what device they were using, and where they came from, amongst other digital analytics data.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">This intelligence helps you to prioritize which marketing channels to spend more or less time on, based on the number of people those channels are driving to your website. For example, if only 10% of your traffic is coming from organic search, you know that you probably need to spend some time on SEO to increase that percentage.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">With digital marketing, you can identify trends and patterns in people’s behavior before they’ve reached the final stage in their buyer’s journey, meaning you can make more informed decisions about how to attract them to your website right at the top of the marketing funnel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="_2cuy _50a1 _2vxa"><span class="_4yxr">Content Performance and Lead Generation</span> :</h3>
<ul class="_5a_q _5yj1" dir="ltr">
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">If you create a product brochure and post it on your website, you can easily measure exactly how many people viewed the page where it’s hosted, and you can collect the contact details of those who download it by using forms. Not only you can measure how many people are engaging with your content, but you’re also generating qualified leads when people download it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="_2cuy _50a1 _2vxa"><span class="_4yxr">Attribution Modeling</span> :</h3>
<ul class="_5a_q _5yj1" dir="ltr">
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">In attribution modeling an effective digital marketing strategy, combined with the right tools and technologies allows you to trace all of your sales back to a customer’s first digital touchpoint with your business. It allows you to identify trends in the way people research and buy your product, helping you to make more informed decisions about what parts of your marketing strategy deserve more attention, and what parts of your sales cycle need refining.</li>
<li class="_2cuy _509q _2vxa">Connecting the dots between marketing and sales is hugely important &#8212; according to Aberdeen Group, companies with strong sales and marketing alignment achieve a 20% annual growth rate, compared to a 4% decline in revenue for companies with poor alignment. If you can improve your customer&#8217;s’ journey through the buying cycle by using digital technologies, then it’s likely to reflect positively on your business’s bottom line.</li>
